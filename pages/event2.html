      <div class="reviews-content-good">Words cannot express the joy I felt while witnessing such a beautiful event. The soft, gentle beat 
      brings such an appreciation of life and its many intricacies. The precision of the one wielding the instruments was impeccable; I couldn't 
      in all my many years of musical experience replicate this divine experience. I also cannot overlook the surgeon's contentment with his 
      performance: that, to me, made the biggest impact.</div>

      <div class="reviews-content-good">This was quite an interesting performance. The movement between musicians and players was quite
        intricate. It was clear that the conductor was really calling all the shots. I mean, most conductors do, but this one was quite
        dominating and quite literally calling out what he wanted the other musicians to do, what instruments they should play or provide
        and HE did most of the music making. How odd. What about just waving the conductor stick around? What about SILENTLY leading his crew?
        I guess he was taking things in a new direction, but it realy put himself in the spotlight. It was a fun an unique experience.</div>

      <div class="reviews-content-bad">I renig my last sentiment. This was not a fun and unique experience. The security threw us out,
        saying we were unsanitary and not allowed to attend this performance. I showed them the tickets I had drawn up on lined paper
        but they didn't accept that. I'm offended in the extreme. That's the last time I try attending a show hosted by Intermountain
        Heath Care.</div>
