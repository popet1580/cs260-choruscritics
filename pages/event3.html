      <div class="reviews-content-good">Wow. Just. Wow! This performance was amazing! The way the men ran onto the stage brought a 
        special energy, and that energy lasted the entire performance. The first note they sang was just divine! Their vowels were just flawless 
        throughout, and I could tell their soft palates were all lifted just perfectly! The mood they brought when they sing had great contrast. 
        When they sang slow, spiritual songs, their voices were prefectly smooth, and for the louder, more powerful songs, I could feel their power! 
        The performance kept me engaged the entire time. Bravo, I say!!!<br/>P. S. That guy in the front row on the left looks very familiar...</div>

      <div class="reviews-content-bad">So I'm sitting in these thick plush chairs. The room is dark. The crowd is silent.
        I'm just about ready to hunker down for my long awaited nap, when suddenly **BOOM** like a million dudes in matching
        suits march into the room. What a ruckus they made. I thought this was going to be an evening of meditation and blissful
        silence but boy, was I wrong. Was it false advertising? What it misleading signs? I thought the night would turn out
        much differently. I'm, understandably, dissapointed.</div>

      <div class="reviews-content-good">Seriously, Prim?!? I cannot see how you fail to discern this quality music from the other atrocities 
        we regularly listen to. This is a stroke of excellence! Additionally, why on earth would you pay money to take a nap in an AUDITORIUM SEAT?!? 
        Talk about uncomfortable. Next time you want a peaceful relaxing auditorium nap, go see John Cage's 4'33", for crying out loud!</div>
